%h2 FAQ


%p
  %h4 Can I use this?
  You can not use it if you had multiple employers, income from interest or dividends, need to adjust medicare or social security taxes. If you are the default case of one job and no other taxable income you are probably fine -- but don't forget that this comes with no warranty and it is your responsibility to ensure correctness.

%p
  %h4 Is this really free? Why?
  Yes and the source code is available under GNU AGPLv3. There are many professional tax preparers and my software is not certified, so I am not permitted to charge any money. Also, this comes without any warranty. Use at your own risk - no refunds on open source!

%p
  %h4 Why did you build this?
  Because I had to file a tax return as an intern once and it took me a lot of time. This is my way of sharing knowledge

%p
  %h4 Why did you not just use TurboTax instead?
  As far as I know Turbotax does not permit filing as a non-resident. The IRS says that you are a not a tax-resident here:

  %h4 Which nationalities can use this service?
  Unfortunately only German is implemented so far. Please support me with pull requests.

%p
  %h4 Which state tax returns are supported?
  None, California will be added soon though
%p
  %h4 How can you guarantee there won't be any errors in my tax return?
  I can't and I don't! Actually you need to check for correctness - it is your responsibility!  I am not a lawyer or any other form of tax professional. This also comes without warranty.

%p
  %h4 I don't trust your software!
  That's absolutely fine - please feel under no obligation to use it. There are plenty of professional and affordable tax preparer services available. If you want to support me anyway, here is my affiliate link of a tax service I have used in the past:

%p
  %h4 Do I have to print and sign the forms or can I submit it online?
  Unfortunately you do have to print and mail the forms. Maybe I will apply for IRS eFile integration in the future.
